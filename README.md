#Blockchain technology

For this project we had to implement a blockchain in such a way that messages could be send to the different nodes that are using the blockchain.

We use p2p to establish connections between the different nodes. 
depending on the role of the node the node would either receive the message or not receive the message at all.
Every node is able to make a personal and private key and use these keys to create a new message and send it to the specific role.
